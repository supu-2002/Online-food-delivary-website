            Online ordering is an increasingly growing trend, it has potentially
            become "the tool" for the food industry to reach out to their
            customers directly. The rise of internet and proliferation of
            smartphones has made our lives increasingly dependent on these
            devices, similarly, the catering industry has emerged to serve these
            tech savvy internet users. Chances are that if you have an online
            ordering system, then you would be better recognised than the
            competition, improving your sales and enabling a good customer
            experience. If your catering business is not online yet, then you
            are certainly losing out on potential customers but also running
            behind most of your competition.

            Simply and safely deliver products to local customers without having
            to rely on logistics companies .Meal delivery orders are typically
            on demand, intended to be eaten right away, and include hot,
            already-prepared food. While some service providers offer
            subscription services, ordering for delivery usually involves
            contacting a local restaurant or chain by telephone or online...

          <p class="center">
            Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant,
            store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a
            customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or
            grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company.
            The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or
            grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The
            delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities
            where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes
            or motorized scooters. Recently, autonomous vehicles have also been
            used to complete deliveries.
